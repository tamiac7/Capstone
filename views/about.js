      <u>Why The Architect & You Experience?</u>
    </h3>
    <div class="Info">
      <p>
        The Architect & You was created to help clients and designers connect
        virtually for a fun hands on, interactive experience while creating the
        home of their dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a way for Architects like myself and others to stay
        connected with new and existing client's. Creating your dream home
        should be an enjoyable experience and I hope The Architect & You will
        get you excited about being a participate and a designer too.
