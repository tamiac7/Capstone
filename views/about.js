          <p>
            The Architect & You was created to help clients and designers
            connect virtually for a fun hands on, interactive experience while
            creating the home of their dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to create a way for Architects like myself and others to
            stay connected with new and existing client's. Creating your dream
            home should be an enjoyable experience and I hope The Architect &
            You will get you excited about being a participate and a designer
            too.
